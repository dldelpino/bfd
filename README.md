# Battle Frontier Pokédex

This project consists on an interactive database which collects every Pokémon set that can be used by Gen 4 Battle Frontier trainers, with a search bar that allows filtering the sets by move, item, Pokémon name, nature, trainer name or trainer class. 

Sets and moves data is gathered in JSON files which have been generated by scraping [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/) with the Python scripts `sets_generator.py` and `moveType_generator.py`. Item and Pokémon icons have been extracted from [Lewtwo](https://x.com/Lewchube)'s [Pokémon Asset Archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16bSaqcst0tOMsz4rGBzPK_iZvgx4DZJX). 

Pokémon genders and abilities are randomly generated, whereas IVs are fixed but depend on current streak of defeated trainers. Battle Factory trainers use Pokémon from this same roster, but are not tied to any set of Pokémon. Battle Hall trainers use completely different sets. See [this page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Battle_Frontier_Trainers_in_Generation_IV) for further information about Battle Frontier trainers in Pokémon Platinum, HeartGold and SoulSilver.

Future plans on this project include:
- Adding the range of consecutive battles won in which every trainer can appear.
- Improving the overall look and design of the page.
- Implementing more complex search filters.
